# Finetuning-Music-Transformer
Eric Lin | Spring 2022

Transfer learning Google Magenta Music Transformer to datasets of different genres of music (e.g. classical, jazz, and pop piano).

Please see `sample_generated_music` directory for examples of music generated by trained models. `Primed` refers to samples (appropriately titled) that were all primed on a specific segment of a well-known song (e.g. Happy Birthday). `Improv` refers to generating samples from a random starting snippet from the training dataset.
